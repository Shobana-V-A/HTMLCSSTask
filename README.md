A simple and interactive Memory Card Matching Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (DOM Manipulation). The goal of the game is to find all matching pairs of cards by flipping them two at a time.
Click the Restart Game button at any time to reshuffle and start over.
If the cards match, they stay flipped.
If the cards do not match, they flip back after a short delay.
